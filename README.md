# Sorting-Algorithms-Time-Complexity
In this project there are several sorting algorithms (i.e. Bubble sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, Selection sort etc.). The main task is to compare run time complexity of each algorithm on a random dataset of certain size.
The main project file is project.py
other instructions are written in readme.txt including project report.
